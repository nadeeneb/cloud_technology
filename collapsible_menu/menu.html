He is known as an Utaite, which is a subculture of singers and vocalists who perform and sing song covers, as well as their own music. They are also known to hardly show their faces. Mafumafu's vocal range is impressive, as he can go from singing lively songs to the very emotional ones. His most popular song is his cover of "Hated by Life Itself", which has gained an astounding 145 million views.Mafumafu normally performs by himself, but he often sings with other utaite. The one he collaborates the most with is Soraru.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 p-3 m-4 rounded"> <h2 class="srrtitle"><u>Soraru</u></h2><p class="srrp">Soraru is another popular Japanese singer who sings in a deeper range. Although he is not quite as popular as Mafumafu, he still gains an adequate following on his social media (1.22 million subscribers on YouTube). His character consists of dark blue hair with the same color eyes. His mascot is a little pillow named Hanpen. Soraru sings solo sometimes, but other times he collaborates with other utaite; namely Mafumafu. They have created a band together in 2015 named After the Rain, in which they sing covers and original songs. One of their most popular songs is the Pokemon Journey's opening song, "1・2・3", which accumulated 31 million views on YouTube.</p></div>
