    <img class="sage" src="images/sage.webp" alt="sage">
    <p class="tradinginfo">The Second Main Game is introduced in a different way from the First Main Game. In the First Game, the characters would find random cards around the area which would tell them their role during the main game. However, because everybody knows which role does what, these roles are implemented differently for the Second Main Game. Every character gets a tablet, which allows them to trade roles with other people. However, these trades are not free, as they can abuse these trades. They would have to pay with tokens they have recieved during the Second Floor. This also makes it so that there are a limited amount of trades. The one problem with trading is that the characters only know their own role, not anybody else's. This makes trading hard and especially unnecessary if a character has a card such as the Commoner, Sage, or Keymaster. Trading, however, can be used to gain a person's trust, as shown at one point in the game. They can also be used to ruin a person's trust as well. </p>
